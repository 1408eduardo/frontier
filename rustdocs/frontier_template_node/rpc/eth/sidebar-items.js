This trait is quite similar to the runtime API, and indeed oe implementation of it uses the runtime API.

Using such an optimized implementation avoids spawning a runtime and the overhead associated with it."]],"type":[["FeeHistoryCache",""],["FeeHistoryCacheLimit","Maximum fee history cache size."],["FilterPool","On-memory stored filters created through the `eth_newFilter` RPC."]]};
